# Express & Next.js Full-Stack Boilerplate with tRPC, Prisma, and PostgreSQL

A modern, development-ready (not production-ready yet :) ) full-stack boilerplate built with Next.js 15+, tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and Express.js. This template provides everything you need to start building your application with best practices and a powerful tech stack.

# 🚀 Roadmap

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**

  - Next.js 15+
  - React 19
  - Tailwind CSS
  - React Query
  - TypeScript

- **Backend:**

  - tRPC
  - Express.js
  - Prisma ORM

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hcikikci/express-next-trpc-boilerplate
```

2. Start the backend services with Docker:

```bash
cd express-next-trpc-boilerplate
cd backend
npm install
cd ..
docker-compose up -d
cd backend
npm run migrate
```

This will set up PostgreSQL, Redis, and the backend service with all the necessary environment configurations.

3. Set up the frontend:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and the backend API will be running at `http://localhost:4000`.

## 🔧 Development

- Backend development is done through Docker, with hot-reload enabled
- Frontend development runs locally for the best development experience
- Database migrations can be run using:
  ```bash
  npm run migrate
  ```
